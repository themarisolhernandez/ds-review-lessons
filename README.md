## Opening Notebooks in CodeSpace

Due to the interactive elements in these notebooks, I recommend opening them in Codespace. CodeSpace provides an interactive environment where you can run and modify code in the cloud. Simply fork this repo and create a codespace on master.

## Installing Required Modules

Before running the notebooks, make sure to install all the required Python modules. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
