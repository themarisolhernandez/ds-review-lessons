# Data Science Curriculum Notebooks

Welcome to the Data Science Curriculum Notebooks repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering various topics in the field of data science. These notebooks are designed to supplement your learning and provide hands-on practice with real-world datasets and examples.

## Notebooks

You can find the following notebooks in this repository:
- [Notebook 1: Descriptive Statistics](01-descriptive-statistics.ipynb)
- [Notebook 2: Hypothesis Testing](02-hypothesis-testing.ipynb)
- [Notebook 3: Simple Linear Regression](03-simple-linear-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 4: Multiple Linear Regression](04-multiple-linear-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 5: Regularized Linear Regression](05-regularized-linear-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 6: Logistic Regression](06-logistic-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 7: Decision Trees](07-decision-trees.ipynb)

Feel free to explore and review these notebooks at your own pace.

## Opening Notebooks in CodeSpace

Due to the interactive elements in these notebooks, I recommend opening them in Codespace. CodeSpace provides an interactive environment where you can run and modify code in the cloud. Simply fork this repo and create a codespace on master.

## Installing Required Modules

Before running the notebooks, make sure to install all the required Python modules. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
