It is widely used for prediction and forecasting in various fields such as economics, finance, and science.\n","\n","Assuming that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable and that this relationship can be represented by a straight line (or hyperplane), it aims to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes this relationship. \n","\n","### Applications:\n","- **Predicting Exam Scores:** Imagine you have data on students' study hours and their corresponding exam scores. You can use linear regression to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.\n","\n","- **Forecasting House Prices:** Suppose you have data on house sizes (in square feet) and their selling prices. You can use linear regression to predict the selling price of a house based on its size.\n","\n","- **Estimating Gas Mileage:** If you have data on cars' engine sizes and their corresponding gas mileage, you can use linear regression to predict a car's gas mileage based on its engine size.\n","\n","## Theory Behind Linear Regression"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Recall the equation for a straight line from your early math classes,\n","\n","$$ y = mx + b$$\n","\n","The equation represents a straight line where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n","\n","Here's a Python code example using `matplotlib` to plot the line represented by the equation $ y = mx + b$ and allowing you to adjust the values of $m$ and $b$."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"metadata":{}},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"c9cd13fb3f524310a2d65bea8e5b6596","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["interactive(children=(FloatSlider(value=0.0, description='Slope (m)', max=10.0, min=-10.0, step=1.0), FloatSli…"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":["<function __main__.plot_line(m, b)>"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","from ipywidgets import interact, FloatSlider\n","\n","# Function to plot the line\n","def plot_line(m, b):\n","    x_vals = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\n","    y_vals = m * x_vals + b\n","    plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))\n","    plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, color='red', label=f'y = {m:.2f}x + {b:.2f}')\n","    plt.xlabel('X')\n","    plt.ylabel('y')\n","    plt.title('y = mx + b')\n","    plt.legend()\n","    plt.grid(True)\n","    plt.xlim(0, 10)\n","    plt.ylim(-20, 20)\n","\n","# Define sliders for m and b\n","m_slider = FloatSlider(min=-10, max=10, step=1, value=0, description='Slope (m)')\n","b_slider = FloatSlider(min=-10, max=10, step=1, value=0, description='Intercept (b)')\n","\n","# Create interactive plot\n","interact(plot_line, m=m_slider, b=b_slider)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Now imagine we have data on house sizes (in square feet) and their selling prices.

metrics. These metrics help quantify how well the model fits the data and how accurate its predictions are.\n","\n","#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n","\n","Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides a straightforward interpretation of the model's predictive accuracy.\n","\n","Mathematically, MAE is calculated as:\n","\n","$$ MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i| $$\n","\n","where:\n","- $ n $ is the number of samples\n","- $ y_i $ is the actual target value for the $ i $-th sample\n","- $ \\hat{y}_i $ is the predicted target value for the $ i $-th sample\n","\n","#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n","\n","Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones.\n","\n","Mathematically, MSE is calculated as:\n","\n","$$ MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 $$\n","\n","#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n","\n","Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the Mean Squared Error. It is often preferred over MSE because it is in the same units as the target variable, making it more interpretable.\n","\n","Mathematically, RMSE is calculated as:\n","\n","$$ RMSE = \\sqrt{MSE} $$\n","\n","#### R-squared ($ R^2 $) Score\n","\n","R-squared ($ R^2 $) score, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It provides an indication of the goodness of fit of the model.\n","\n","The $ R^2 $ score ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n","- 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variability in the target variable\n","- 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains the variability in the target variable\n","\n","The $ R^2 $ score is calculated as:\n","\n","$$ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} $$\n","\n","where:\n","- $ \\bar{y} $ is the mean of the actual target values\n","\n","When interpreting the $ R^2 $ score, it's essential to compare it with the $ R^2 $ score of a baseline model (e.g., a model that always predicts the mean of the target variable). A higher $ R^2 $ score indicates that the model performs better than the baseline model.\n","\n","#### Implementing Model Performance Metrics with `scikit-learn`\n","\n","To calculate these performance metrics using `scikit-learn`, we can use the appropriate functions provided by the `metrics` module.
